In 1525, during the aftermath of the Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521), Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, and his nephew, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, agreed that the latter would resign his position, adopt Lutheran faith and assume the title of Duke of Prussia. Thereafter referred to as Ducal Prussia, remaining a Polish fief. Thus in a deal partially brokered by Martin Luther, Roman Catholic Teutonic Prussia was transformed into the Duchy of Prussia, the first Protestant state. Sigismund's consent was bound to Albert's submission to Poland, which became known as the Prussian Homage.

 vu_pagan.1.t:0 "Last Greenland colonies fail"
 vu_pagan.1.d:0 "Norse colonizers discovered and settled Greenland around the year 1000. Since then, a small colony on Southwestern coast has been established. It reached its peak prosperity around 13th century, after which it began slowly declining due to many reasons such as climate changes, depletion of resources, declining help from Iceland, lowered trade relations from black death and declining importance of Icelanding fish exports. After many harsh years, last remaining settlements there gave up of further continuing this agony. What could've been salvaged, was salvaged and ships filled with norse refugees are set to soon arrive in Iceland. What should we do about those norse refugees?"
